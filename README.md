# Would you rather game

The game consists of questions with two possible answers typically difficult to choose between. Users can have a look at the existing set of questions, answer them, be creative and add some more questions to the quiz, check out the question results and consult the leader board. Just get started by logging in if you already have an account or sign up as a new user.

This repo is a personal project made for learning purposes in the [React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019). It has been structured using ducks in order to make it scalable.
